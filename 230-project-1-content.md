# CER: Combat Environment Recovery

### *A Web Game by Jordan Machalek*

Ever wish that Minesweeper was a little more action-packed? Then you've come to the right place. Take control of a flail-tank patrolling and 
the clearing mines in the desert sands in this top-down web game. But stay alert - the enemy may still be near.

## Premise

The player in CER: Combat Environment Recovery finds themself taking control of a modern mine-clearing vehicle as a military engineer. On the 
heels of a recent conflict in an unknown desert land, it is their duty to ensure that the land is safe for civilians to return to. Travelling 
through the area of operation the player must locate and destroy unexploded munitions hidden in the sand. At the same time they and their 
crewmates may encounter hostile patrols that have refused to stand down following the end of the major fighting and must either avoid or 
eliminate them.

## Art & Aesthetics

The style for the game is basic in regards to graphics. Game objects will have a low level of detail though enough for any object to be 
recognized for what it is meant to be.

### Sound

Sound for the game may include some tense orchestral music. Otherwise, player actions will have related sound effects including, but not
limited to: tank tread movement, explosions, breaking metal. Ambient sounds may also be included such as desert insects or wind-blown sand.

## Gameplay

## Mechanics

The core mechanic of CER will center around the player's vehicle being able to detect mines and other dangerous objects within a certain
radius. Once detected, the player will have a variety of methods for dealing with the threat including simply digging it up and destroying it
using the tank's front-mounted flail or launching a controlled explosive charge at the area where the object is thought to be located. 

The vehicle will have a health system attached to it. Damage may be caused by explosives which are not detected until it is too late or by 
enemy forces.

As development time allows, random patrols of enemies may be included throughout the map which will attack the player on sight. To defend
themselves, the player's tank will also be equipped with a crew-served weapon to deal with enemy infantry.

### End Condition

While being based upon a somewhat serious premise, the more abstract goal for the player of CER will be to acheive a highscore. The player
will recieve a varying amount of points for each threat removed from the game world. The game ends when the player's tank recieves too much
damage and is destroyed.

### Control

Control for the game will support keyboard input only using *WASD* or the Arrow Keys for movement with other keys being mapped to player 
abilities as appropriate.
